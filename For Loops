Types of for loops:

for char in str:
  char = the character itself in the string

for i in range(len(str):
  i = index of char

for i, n in enumerate(str):
  i = index
  n = character in string

for a, b in listOfTuples:
  a = first part of tuple
  b = second part of tuple

#given that a, b, c are numbers defined in parameters
for amount, char in [(-a, "a"), (-b, "b"), (-c, "c")]:
  you can define a list in the for loop parameters and assign a, b, and c to the characters they represent
